CARNEIRO, M. M. de O. Study and analysis of an instrumentation and filtering system in order to measure electrical signals in plants. 92p. Undergraduate Thesis - Federal Center of Technological Education â€“ Rio de Janeiro. Rio de Janeiro, 2021. 

Electrical signals are generated and transmitted through the plants in response to a stimulus caused by a factor localized in the external environment, furthermore, these signals allow the whole structure of the plant to be informed almost instantly. Taking into consideration action potentials (APs), variation potentials (VPs) and systemic potentials (SPs), even if a small region of it has suffered a disturb, the excitation will be transmitted from the top of the stem to the roots, in either direction. The motivation of this project is the fact that by analyzing the electrical signal of a specific plant, it is possible to describe the impact of external aspects (thermal shock, insects infestation, leaf burning) in the plasma membrane potential and identify the electrical signal nature. In this project is studied an instrumentation and filtering system that can be applied to signals of various plants types. This project approaches plant electrophysiology theory, additionally, it presents a low-cost system which has got a signal conditioning circuit and another one for measuring environmental parameters, moreover, the latter consists in the use of an Arduino alongside a soil moisture sensor, DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor, a luminosity sensor GY-302, an air quality MQ-135 sensor, real-time clock module RTC DS3231, in addition to an SD card module (in order to store the acquired data). Furthermore, this work showed good cost-benefit electrodes that can be easily found in retail, which are surface electrodes (Ag/AgCl), widely used in medical practice (ECG) along with needle electrodes (stainless steel). To conclude, MATLAB software was used so the digital filtering of the electrical signal could be done after passing through the signal conditioning circuit.
